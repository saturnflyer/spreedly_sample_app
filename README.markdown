# Sample Spreedly App

This application uses the [rspreedly](http://gemcutter.org/gems/rspreedly) gem and is currently a total hack.

I'm using it to figure out a manageable way to connect to [Spreedly](http://spreedly.com/) such as synching subscription plans as well as users, and to learn about creating plugin engines. See the `vendor/plugins/spreedly_connect` code. That will eventually be broken out into a separate project/gem.

Be sure to set these environment variables: SPREEDLY_API_TOKEN and SPREEDLY_SITE_NAME
