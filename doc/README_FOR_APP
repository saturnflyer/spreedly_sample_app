This Spreedly Sample App will show you how to create an application that connects to the Spreedly API.

It uses the rspreedly gem.

You must set these environment variables for the user that runs this application. Here is an example for bash:

    export SPREEDLY_API_TOKEN=yourlongtokenstringhere
    export SPREEDLY_SITE_NAME=sitenameusedinspreedlyurls

In your Spreedly account, you'll need to set the "Subscribers Changed Notification URL" to the one created by your routes. Your routes file by default will create a path for this purpose at "/users/yourlongtokenstringhere" to which Spreedly may post an updated user list. If you don't want to use your API key, you should use some other non-guessable string to prevent attacks on your site from causing unusual and unnecessary requests to the Spreedly API.
